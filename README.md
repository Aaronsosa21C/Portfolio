# Portfolio
This is a repository that will house my Portfolio and smaller projects that I see fit to join it.

When it comes down to how I want to persue my career in CyberSecurity, I take a look at myself and my current
strengths and weaknesses. I've developed a solid foundation with my programing skills, learning the fundimentals
such as Python, C+ and a touch of HTML I believe once I am able to expand these skills I could become a worthy
